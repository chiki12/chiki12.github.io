## project name: Data anaysis of F1 dara

#### Team member: 
Chiki Luo, Alejandro C., David M., Ismael Z., Alberto F.

#### Briefly introduction: 
Formula 1(F1) is the highest class of international auto racing. In this group project, we choose Formula 1 data because of its profound emphasis on data collection and analysis. We aimed to analysis F1 data and decipher the complexities by applying machine learning techniques to see how variables work for predicting result. Methods including PCA, cluster analysis, linear regression, naie bayes, and neural networks.


#### My focus: 
neural networks

    Actual values vs. predicted values of the model. We can see predictions are entirely inaccurate within the critical 0-20 range, rendering them impractical for effective Formula 1 performance forecasting.
